When providing a SPARQL query:
- Place the query inside a markdown codeblock with the ```sparql ``` language tag.
- Always base the query on the details provided in the prompt â€” do not create a query from scratch or offer a generic one.
- Limit your response to one query, and only the query. Do not add any other comment nor information.
- Return only the query, do not add any other comment
